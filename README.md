# 🎛️ FL Studio Tweaks & Advancements

> 🚀 **An educational modding & research project** exploring FL Studio’s inner workings, audio routing, and experimental features — built purely for learning and creative tinkering.

## ❓ Reg Key
The reg key (key used for fl studio) can be found in the branch above under [Key gen FL25.1.reg]() ---> This is a free experimental key , this is not for obtaining a cracked version of Fl studio


## 🌟 Overview

This project is my personal sandbox for testing FL Studio behaviors, crafting prototype tools, and studying how routing, stems, and signal flow interact under the hood.

💡 **Goals:**

* Understand how FL Studio handles complex mixer routing.
* Build experimental tools like a *Stem Splitter* to improve workflow.
* Log findings & observations safely for educational purposes.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** Everything here is for **educational and ethical research only.** No proprietary code, DRM bypassing, or exploit distribution is included or supported.

## 🧩 Core Features

### 🎚️ Stem Splitter

A non-destructive tool concept that automatically separates a project’s key elements — drums, bass, vocals, FX, etc. — into clean stereo stems for analysis and re-export. Perfect for studying mixing and mastering techniques.

### 🔁 Routing Experiments

Alternative mixer templates and scripts that explore unconventional (yet safe) signal flow setups, automation routing, and bus architectures.

### 🔍 Audio Inspection Tools

Lightweight Python utilities for consistent A/B exports, helping detect subtle changes in loudness, stereo width, or plugin behavior across FL versions.

### 📘 Research Notes

Markdown files documenting discoveries, test setups, and reproducible project states — ideal for version-by-version comparison.

## 🛠️ Setup & Usage

1. **Clone this repo:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/FL-Studio-Tweaks.git
   cd FL-Studio-Tweaks
   ```

2. **(Optional) Install Python dependencies:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate   # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Explore:**

   * `tools/stem_splitter.py` → for non-destructive stem organization
   * `templates/` → experimental FLP routing setups
   * `docs/` → logs & educational findings

> 💾 Always test with *copies* of your FLP files — never original projects.

## 🧠 Responsible Research

If you happen to uncover unusual behavior or a potential vulnerability:

1. **Do not** share exploit details publicly.
2. **Report it responsibly** to Image-Line through official support channels.
3. Only document findings *after* any issues are fixed.

This project stands for **ethical discovery, transparency, and respect for developers.** 🫡

## 🤝 Contributing

Want to add your own experiments or findings?

* Stick to ethical, non-invasive exploration.
* Avoid including any proprietary material.
* Open a clear Issue before submitting PRs.

✨ Every contribution that helps others learn about audio engineering, routing, or digital sound design is welcome.

## 🚧 Roadmap

* 🔧 Enhance the Stem Splitter to auto-detect common bus names.
* 🧪 Add tests for stem export validation & naming consistency.
* 🪄 Create a minimal GUI for stem preview & organization.
* 🎨 Add visualization tools for routing and frequency overlap.
