# FL Studio Modx

**FL Studio Modx** is an experimental project focused on learning, research, and creative modification around FL Studio. This repository is a playground for exploring ideas, tools, and concepts related to workflow customization and visual experimentation.

> ⚠️ This project is for **educational and experimental purposes only**.

## ✨ What Is This?

FL Studio Modx is an ongoing project where I experiment with:

* Workflow tweaks and utilities
* Visual and UI-related concepts
* Tooling ideas that could enhance personalization

Nothing here is meant to replace or redistribute FL Studio itself.

## 🎨 Custom Themer (Work in Progress)

🚧 **Custom Themer — In Development**

I am currently working on a **custom theming system** that will eventually allow users to:

More details, documentation, and examples will be added once development progresses.
